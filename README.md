## Description

<p align="justify">
EzGitDoc is a project which received 'under work' status to create webpage where user can prepare <em>.md</em> document scheme "live" and then obtain result as generated code ready to paste into file, to encourage people with making interesting documentations rather than leaving repository only with directory structure and primarily to make something useful(I guess). It was made as a page using HTML and JavaScript to independent potential users from necessity to install extra software(you only need to enter site generated by github pages from link on the top of the repository for e.g.). The one required element is.. using modern browser in order to make all JS code work flawlessly. The process of creating doc scheme can look to You kinda similiar to creating WordPress webpage(well, it looks to me like that :alien:). You can switch elements between themselves, delete them, generate new. More data about EzGitDoc itself you can find on website. Here I wanted to focus on listing used libraries, showing some screenshots. Each element that EzGitDoc allow to create is showed in Help section on page.
