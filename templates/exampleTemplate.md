<p align="justify">I created library called <strong>Example</strong> that shows available items in the store. If you like it ensure that you follow me for more data! In the future I plan to put crucial info on big discounts! </p>

<h4>Pros of Example</h4>

:sparkles: <strong>Exampled:</strong> see a story and example<br><br>
:sparkles: <strong>Exampled second time:</strong> see more than one story!<br><br>
:sparkles: <strong>Exampled third time:</strong> see at least 100 stories for extra info<br><br>

| Example Customer | Opinion |
| :---: | :---: |
| Alicia | Well, I didn't like clothes that were on sale but must admit, these discounts are so generous! |
| Tom | I found in Project Example new clock and graphic card |
