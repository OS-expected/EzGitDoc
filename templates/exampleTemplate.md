Short Description <br/> 
<!-- Put under this comment short description of the template, pros, experience with that way of showing data etc. -->
My template targets repositories that concern example. Here you will find banner image to attract reader, listed pros of using Project Example and some reviews from customers in tabular form. I recommend setting up document that way if you need to advert your product. There must be some images too!
